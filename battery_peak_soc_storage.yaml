# Battery Peak SOC Storage Configuration
# This file creates input_number helpers to store the highest SOC value
# reached by each battery for improved battery protection logic
# 
# These helpers need to be included in your Home Assistant configuration.yaml:
# input_number: !include battery_peak_soc_storage.yaml
#
# Or added manually via the UI under Settings > Devices & Services > Helpers

input_number:
  # Peak SOC storage for each battery
  # Note: You may need to add/remove entries based on your actual battery names
  # The automation will create these automatically when it runs, but having them
  # predefined ensures they persist through restarts
